Wonderful project idea . Fitness and diet are very important and always relevant subjects.
app.js (server) is orginised and clean with routers and serving static html files.
Good structure of database with routes, controllers and models.
Also sending a JWT token which is a very good practice for autherisation.
Good job with the LOGIN AND REGISTER functionality , hashing the password with bcrypt.
Also the use of exceptions (try , catch) is great and useful.
A video was shared but without public access privelages so unfortunatly I could not see the project in action.

Great job guys!!!
